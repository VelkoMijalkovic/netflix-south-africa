Netflix Clone



A Netflix Clone using the tmdb api with custom list with CRUD capabilities for custom user lists.

Getting Started Dependencies
Vue Js CDN is provided and used in all pages of the application
HTML, JavaScript, Vue.js, tmdb api key

You will most likely have to replace my tmdb api key with your own if you so wish


Installation

None
Vue Js CDN is included, this project did not make use of the Vue CLI so some workarounds had to be done as Vue JS does not support inserting Vue Directives dynamically
without the use of components e.g @click will not be recognized when inserting HTML directly into the DOM so onclick (JS) was used instead

Executing program

Right click -> Open to view
Or start in live server


Help
 API key can be declared globally which would remove a couple of lines of code
